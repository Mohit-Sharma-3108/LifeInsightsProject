==========
Project: Single Habit Tracker

Purpose
----------
Replace ad-hoc Whatsapp habit tracking with a minimal, structured system that can:
- Store habits
- Show consistency and missed days
- Answer: "Am I doing this habit regularly?"

This MVP intentionally supports:
- ONE user
- ONE habit
- NO AI

Habit (Frozen for 14 days)
----------
Habit Name: Focussed work on this project
Metric: Minutes and a scale that quantifies the amount of focussed work done (0 is super distracted work, working while listening to music and checking social media while 10 is supremely focussed work, working and not able to keep track of time, forgetting other important tasks in the day)
Target: 60 minutes and focussed work with 6 level of focussed work.
Frequency: Daily

Goal (Frozen for 14 days)
----------
Create website with minimal UI that replaces ad-hoc Whatsapp habit tracking completely. Website should answer the questions mentioned in the purpose section along with the following questions:
- Consistency percentage (day wise)
- Missed days
- Average minutes per day

Freeze Rule
----------
- Habit and Goal definition cannot be edited for 14 days
- Only logs can be added
